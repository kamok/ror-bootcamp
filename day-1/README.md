## Steps
###1. Get Ruby installed. 

We recommend using [Rails Installer](http://www.railsinstaller.org), as it also provides some tools that you will need in the future. You know you've got Ruby when you get a version number after typing `ruby -v` into the command line.


###2. Get a text editor. 
We recommend [Atom](http://www.atom.io), since it's the new wave. But feel free to use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) instead.


###3. Read chapters 0-5 of [*Learn to Program*](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html).

Make sure you attempt all of the challenges in the book, and have a go at every **A Few Things to Try** section.

Commit all of your code to a repository on [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

### Bonus Questions

####Question 1: Find the Cost of Tile to Cover W x L Floor
```
Description: Ask the user to enter in a width, length and the cost per 1 unit of flooring. 

Have the program calculate how much it would cost to cover the area specified with the flooring.

Tips: This is a relatively simple program. Be sure to first find out how much area the floor is 
and then multiply that by the cost per unit of flooring. Start with some simple numbers that you 
can quickly calculate in your head. 

Try a 10 x 10 ft room with each unit of flooring costing $1.00.

Added Difficulty: Calculate how much flooring would be needed for non-rectangular rooms. 
Also figure out how much labor costs would be given that the average flooring team can 
only put in 20 square feet of flooring per hour at a cost of $86.00/hr.

```

####Question 2: Tax Calculator

```
Description: Create a program which asks the user to enter in a dollar value and the 
current tax percentage. 

Then print out the subtotal along with the total plus tax (grand total).

Tips: This is a very simple program where you collect the value from the user, have the user
enter in a tax value, add the tax to the total and print out the result. If the value the 
user enters is $1.00 and the tax is 5% then the total is $1.05.
